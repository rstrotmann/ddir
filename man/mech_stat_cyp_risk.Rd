\arguments{
\item{perp}{The perpetrator object.}

\item{cyp_inh}{CYP inhibition data as data frame. The following fields are
expected:
\itemize{
\item 'name' The name of the perpetrator compound.
\item 'cyp' The CYP enzyme as (upper case) character.
\item 'ki' The \eqn{K_i} in \eqn{\mu M} as numeric.
\item 'source' Optional source information as character.
}}

\item{cyp_ind}{The CYP induction data as data frame. The following fields
are expected:
\itemize{
\item 'name' The name of the perpetrator compound as character.
\item 'cyp' The CYP enzyme as (upper case) character.
\item 'emax' The \eqn{E_{max}}, i.e., the maximum induction effect determined in
vitro as numeric.
\item 'ec50' The \eqn{EC_{50}} in \eqn{\mu M} as numeric.
\item 'maxc' The maximal concentration in \eqn{\mu M} tested in the in vitro assay as
numeric.

\item{d}{Scaling factor, defaults to 1.}

\item{include_induction}{Switch to define whether induction effects should be
included in the calculation (C-terms as per the FDA guideline)}

\link{cyp_reference_substrates}. The data frame is expected to have the following
fields:

built-in reference data, \link{cyp_turnover}.}

\description{
CYP perpetration risk as per mechanistic-static modeling
}
\details{
In this approach, AUC ratios for CYP-specific probe substrates are calculated
based on their known intestinal and hepatic metabolism. Direct (competitive)
and time-dependent inhibition terms, as well as enzyme induction terms are
considered. For details, refer to section 7.5.1.2 of the \href{https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/ich-m12-guideline-drug-interaction-studies-step-5_en.pdf}{ICH M12 guideline}.

\deqn{AUCR = \frac{1}{A_g*B_g*C_g* \left(1-F_g \right)+F_g} * \frac{1}{A_h*B_h*C_h*f_m+\left(1-f_m\right)}}

The individual terms are:
\subsection{Reversible inhibition}{

\deqn{A_g = \frac{1}{1+\frac{I_g}{K_i}}}

\deqn{A_h = \frac{1}{1+\frac{I_h}{K_i}}}
}

\subsection{Time-dependent inhibition}{

\deqn{B_g = \frac{k_{deg,g}}{k_{deg,g} + \frac{I_g*k_{inact}}{I_g+K_I}}}

\deqn{B_h = \frac{k_{deg,h}}{k_{deg,h} + \frac{I_h*k_{inact}}{I_h+K_I}}}
}

\subsection{Induction}{

\deqn{C_g = 1 + \frac{d*E_{max}*I_g}{I_g+EC_{50}}}

\deqn{C_h = 1 + \frac{d*E_{max}*I_h}{I_h+EC_{50}}}

with the hepatic inlet concentration \eqn{I_h=I_{max,inlet,u}} and the
intestinal concentration \eqn{I_g=I_{enteric,u}}, see
\code{\link[=key_concentrations]{key_concentrations()}}.

\eqn{d} is a scaling factor for the CYP induction term with a standard value
of 1. A different value can be used if warranted by prior experience with the
experimental setup.
